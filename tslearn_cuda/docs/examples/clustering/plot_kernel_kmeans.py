Kernel k-means
==============

This example uses Global Alignment kernel (GAK, [1]) at the core of a kernel
:math:`k`-means algorithm [2] to perform time series clustering.

Note that, contrary to :math:`k`-means, a centroid cannot be computed when
using kernel :math:`k`-means. However, one can still report cluster
assignments, which is what is provided here: each subfigure represents the set
of time series from the training set that were assigned to the considered
cluster.
